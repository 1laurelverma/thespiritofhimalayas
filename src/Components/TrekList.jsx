The trek to Tungnath takes you through rocky terrains, lush meadows, and rhododendron bushes, treating you to stunning views of nature. The sight of the grand Himalayas along the way uplifts the spirits of trekkers. Trek offers clear views of numerous named and unnamed peaks of the majestic Himalayan range.",
